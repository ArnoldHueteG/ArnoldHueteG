Software Engineer and Data Engineer
-----------------------------------

Beginning my career as a Business Analyst and simultaneously pursuing software development as a side hustle, I honed my skills in understanding both business needs and technical solutions. Over the years, I smoothly transitioned into roles such as Data Engineer and Solutions Architect for Data, demonstrating expertise in designing robust data solutions. Currently, as a dedicated backend engineer, I am eagerly poised to expand my skill set and evolve into a well-rounded full-stack developer.
